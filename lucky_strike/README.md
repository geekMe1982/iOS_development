# Lucky Strike game

### (an OOP designed game, Built using SwiftUI with only CODE)
#### The objective of the game is to put the bullseye as close to the target as you can. The bullseye is on a slider that goes from 1 to 100, and the target value is randomly chosen. In the screenshot above, you’re challenged to put the bullseye at 40. Since you can’t see the current value of the slider and there aren’t any markings to help you, you have to “eyeball” it.
## Skills learned:
### • Representing "@state" in the app with a variable
### • Portrait vs. landscape
### • Adding views: VStack, HStack & Spacer
### • Adding padding 
### • Data types: different kinds of data that Swift can work with.
### • Making the slider less annoyingly precise: We don’t need the slider to report its position with six-decimal precision, but to the nearest whole number.

### •Generating and displaying the target value: Select the random number that the player will try to match using the slider and display it onscreen.
### •Calculating the points scored: Determine how many points to award to the player based on how close they came to positioning the slider at the target value.
### •Writing methods
### •Improving the code (DRY): Make the code more readable so that it’s easier to maintain and improve and less error-prone.


### •Generating pseudo-random numbers
### •Algorithms
### •Making decisions with the if statement
### •Adding strings using concatenation and representing special characters with escape sequences.
### •Refactoring
### •The let statement and constants
### •The scope of variables and constants
### •Computed properties
### •closures
### •1x, 2x, and 3x displays
### •ViewModifier
### •Putting images inside buttons
### •Adding a new view "NavigationView"
### •Connecting a button to a view
